# Whole-tree Salts / Salts-utils migration completeness admission

## Immutable source identities

- `qigao/salts@386f81328c656f416d61a6d2ef662f05443e1b4a`, tree `e0c0881d202a8c9620fd7d3d2d4611a03a8aa8df`: **1,554 exact original Git blobs**.
- `qigao/salts-utils@5b0be65de673261fc37b29485b0364ca38cc6cd6`, tree `dfd9db4622f137595a4ca5b7b5abcb60eca95894`: **1,421 exact original Git blobs**.
- Destination comparison baseline: `salts-core@004905642dce8861e39907368e53fa35b37c3cc3` (original Core parity [Draft PR #72](https://github.com/qigao/salts-core/pull/72)), tree `925b15b3f8f88de08164fbaebece42787b2fc622`.

The complete per-file path, byte count, original Git Blob SHA, owner assignment and audit status are frozen in `tools/migration/original-salts-files.json` and `tools/migration/original-salts-utils-files.json`. These inventories are **raw historical snapshots**: they do not get overwritten when a source is subsequently ported. A separate source/function/test evidence record is required to close each item. Git Blob identity is checked byte-for-byte by `tools/check_full_source_migration.py`; deleting, shrinking or rewriting the ledger fails the source gate.

## What the snapshot actually shows

| Source | Core native candidate | Split native / upper-layer bridge | Retained upper repository / support | Directly absent/changed from candidate snapshot | Present but NOT yet behavior-qualified |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Salts | 759 | — | 795 | 379 absent + 77 changed | 303 identical blobs |
| Salts-utils | 126 | 39 | 1,256 | 71 absent + 7 changed + 39 split | 48 identical blobs |
| **Total** | **885** | **39** | **2,051** | **573 missing/changed cases** | **351 present-but-unqualified** |

**Presence is not API parity.** A changed file with the same name requires explicit semantic review. A byte-identical source file still requires CMake build ownership, public header, installed C11/C++17 consumer tests, lifecycle/error semantics, sanitizer and relevant platform evidence. No missing cases are silently waived. The future `--require-complete` gate remains intentionally **RED** until **all 924 native candidate/split cases** have real acceptance evidence.


## Independent native evidence entry point

`tools/check_migration_evidence.py` adds an evidence layer outside the three
frozen source/API inventories. All 2,975 file records, 610 API identities and
their Git Blob hashes remain unchanged. The first reviewed contract,
`tools/migration/native-evidence-contracts.json`, covers only bounded native
SIMD obligations: twelve production/build/test blobs, the immutable
32-function supplement and four required native profiles. It has no
`accepted` or `complete` switch.

`collect` starts from explicitly configured native and installed builds,
adds CMake File API queries, reconfigures and builds each **whole** graph,
installs the SDK, and actually executes three exact native SIMD CTests plus
two exact installed C11/C++17 CTests. It retains target/compile information,
the real archive and executables, installed headers/exports, exact CTest
inventories, JUnit reports and command output, with SHA-256 artifact hashes.
Validation requires the reviewed source blobs, actual target sources/types,
one native owner, the same installed archive, canonical static `Salts::SIMD`,
math linkage, GNU wrap flags and the sanitizer profile's instrumentation.

Candidate identity includes tracked and new uncommitted files, source edits
and deletions. It is checked before and after execution. Concurrent writes
invalidate collection. Builds, SDKs and receipts must be outside the source
tree; Python bytecode and Git-ignored outputs are excluded. Older candidate
receipts never become current evidence through filename matching.

After configuring both builds with the intended compiler and flags:

```sh
python3 -B tools/check_migration_evidence.py collect \
  --native-build /tmp/core-native --installed-build /tmp/core-installed \
  --sdk-prefix /tmp/core-sdk --profile linux-release \
  --output /tmp/core-evidence/linux-release
python3 -B tools/check_migration_evidence.py verify \
  --evidence-dir /tmp/core-evidence
python3 -B tools/check_full_source_migration.py --require-complete \
  --evidence-dir /tmp/core-evidence
```

Enable `BUILD_TESTING`, `SALTSCORE_BUILD_SIMD`, `SALTSCORE_BUILD_TINYTEST` in
the native build. Configure the installed build from `tests/installed` with
`SALTSCORE_REQUIRE_SIMD=ON`. Preserve required generator/provider environment
such as `RE2C_ROOT`. Collect `linux-release`, `linux-asan-ubsan`,
`windows-release` and `macos-release` on their native x86-64 Linux/Windows
or ARM64 macOS runners. The sanitizer build must instrument native and
installed code alike; execution enables leak detection and fail-on-report.

Missing evidence stays pending. An explicitly empty or malformed bundle
fails, as do duplicate profiles, stale trees, altered blobs/reports, missing
targets, disabled features, skipped/failed/zero tests, or a CTest invoking a
different executable. Hand-written `accepted: true` records are rejected.

These are bounded, declared source/build/runtime obligations, not a proof
of every possible behavior or every API's semantic equivalence. Hashes
establish consistency and integrity, not the origin of an arbitrary
downloaded bundle. Release automation must collect in its trusted native
jobs or authenticate their retained artifacts and candidate identity.
A hand-written passing JUnit report is not release authorization.

The first policy returns **no qualified IDs from the original 924 file
obligations or 610 API obligations**. Four validated profiles can establish
the supplement's declared native evidence for 32 functions; all seven
original SIMD file obligations and the original reflection assertions remain
pending. Additional policies require reviewed per-file/per-function owner
maps, semantic differences, test cases and native platform coverage.
`--require-complete` derives live pending obligations from independent
qualified-ID sets, while keeping the historical 573/351 snapshot visible.

AC/Levenshtein IDs are explicitly rejected if a policy attempts to qualify
them while deferred. Even if every other obligation obtains evidence, their
five original files and 26 APIs keep final migration admission blocked.

### Frozen module counts

These are original obligations, not current absent-file counts. A dash in
the API column means the initial 610-function scan did not cover the module.

| Origin / original module | Files | Historical missing/changed | Historical identical | APIs in 610 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Salts `cnet/` | 258 | 165 | 93 | — |
| Salts `utils/` | 175 | 149 | 26 | 476 |
| Salts `unicode/` | 79 | 4 | 75 | — |
| Salts `native-io/` | 64 | 43 | 21 | — |
| Salts `platform/` | 41 | 28 | 13 | — |
| Salts `tinytest/` | 35 | 4 | 31 | — |
| Salts `concurrency/` | 31 | 19 | 12 | — |
| Salts `coroutine/` | 21 | 14 | 7 | — |
| Salts `cserde/` | 17 | 2 | 15 | — |
| Salts `asn1/` | 15 | 15 | 0 | — |
| Salts `idna/` | 9 | 2 | 7 | — |
| Salts `simd/` | 7 | 7 | 0 | 0; 32 supplemental |
| Salts `uri/` | 7 | 4 | 3 | — |
| Salts-utils `unicode/` | 56 | 8 | 48 | — |
| Salts-utils `capture/` | 39 | 39 | 0 | 29 |
| Salts-utils `salts_serial/` | 20 | 20 | 0 | 30 |
| Salts-utils `cflow-fs/` | 19 | 19 | 0 | 25 |
| Salts-utils `playback/` | 11 | 11 | 0 | 17 |
| Salts-utils `cflow-process/` | 10 | 10 | 0 | 20 |
| Salts-utils `cflow-usb/` | 10 | 10 | 0 | 13 |
| **Total** | **924** | **573** | **351** | **610** |

The two Unicode origins remain separate provenance obligations even where
they share the same current implementation. The denominator is not reduced.

## Separate public-function/source ABI ledger

The new `tools/migration/original-public-functions.json` additionally freezes **54 original headers** and **610 distinct explicitly declared public functions**:

- Salts `utils/include/` + `simd/include/`: **36 headers, 476 functions**.
- Salts-utils native Capture/Playback/Serial and CFlow FS/Process/USB headers: **18 headers, 134 functions**, including 30 declared Serial APIs, 26 Capture main-header APIs, 17 Playback APIs, and real CFlow USB/FS native functions.
- Nine nonfunction CMeta metadata declarations (`extern const` data/type descriptors) in `utils/include/cmeta_cmeta_data.h` remain explicitly **unparsed / awaiting upper-layer ownership review**. Macros and inline APIs still require separate manual inventory.
- Each API points to its original header Git Blob and source commit, with `requires-real-implementation-and-behavior-test` status. A matching function name/header alone **does not** close implementation, linkage, lifetime, failure, or testing obligations.
- This ledger is immutable Git Blob `19db69a508c6049afcfe6922e19448f5f9c5d875`; the same `tools/check_full_source_migration.py` checks all 54 original header/source associations and 610 names, catches silent function deletion/renaming, and keeps `--require-complete` **RED** while the function-level claims remain unqualified. The full `CNet/Platform/NativeIO` public API inventory is additional scope and is not falsely represented by these 610 initial functions.

## Current iteration scope

The SIMD source recovery adds a separate
`tools/migration/original-simd-inventory.json` supplement for all **7 original
SIMD files and 32 public execution functions**. The frozen 610-function
inventory lists `simd/include/salts/simd.h` but extracted zero functions from
its unannotated `bool`/`void` declarations. That gap is recorded explicitly;
the original inventories are not rewritten and the 610 count is not treated
as complete SIMD coverage. Source parity, installed/native execution,
CMeta reflection mapping and downstream descriptor ABI admission remain
separate obligations; see `simd/README.md`.

At the user's direction, `Salts::SIMD` is a static module with plain C
declarations and no DLL import/export annotations. Static linkage does not
qualify any frozen source or function record, change numeric behavior, or
close the pending upper-layer reflection and descriptor mapping acceptance.

AC and Levenshtein development and acceptance are deferred by the user. The
working plan lists `ac_automaton` and `levenshtein_automaton` under
`pending_groups.deferred_by_user`, which remains part of the pending total.
The frozen ledgers retain both original header/source pairs and their shared
`utils/tests/test_string_automata.c`: **5 unresolved files**. The original
**16 AC and 10 Levenshtein functions** retain
`requires-real-implementation-and-behavior-test` status. None is marked
migrated, verified or waived, and the **2,975-file / 610-function** baseline
is unchanged. Both `audit_original_utils_parity.py --full` and
`check_full_source_migration.py --require-complete` continue to reject
incomplete migration.

This scope change leaves existing byte and UTF-8 behavior, regex error
handling and resource ownership unchanged. [PR #72](https://github.com/qigao/salts-core/pull/72)
and [PR #94](https://github.com/qigao/salts-core/pull/94) remain **Draft and
must not be merged**.

## Layer ownership contract

- `salts-core`: plain C11 Core, mmap, strings, logging, memory pools, regex, byte scanners; native Platform, Concurrency, NativeIO, SCTP/CNet, Crypto, ASN1, FS, Process, Capture, Playback, Serial, low-level FS watch and native USB transport. Preserve original public behavior, independent lifetime and error paths.
- `salts`: CMeta, CFlow, CSTL, ACE and only genuinely runtime/reflection-specific integration; upper layers may depend on Core, never the reverse.
- `salts-utils` upstream: original parser, JSON/XML/YAML/CSV, Jinja, Mustache, DataBind, bindings and higher-level services remain owned until a separately specified migration; **retained upstream is not deletion**.
- `cflow-fs`, `cflow-process`, `cflow-usb`: split native source/polling/USB/FS owner (Core) from typed reactive publisher/retainer/actor adapters (upper layer). Splitting MUST NOT delete the underlying bounded event, error or teardown semantics.
- `salts_serial`: original port discovery, POSIX termios, Windows COM/SetupAPI, async and SPSC transfer must be reproduced, independent of CMeta type traits and CSTL Vec, with real owner lifetime tests. Preserve all original public functions, not just smoke tests.
- `capture` and `playback`: original audio/video/screen platform behavior, miniaudio and Win/macOS/iOS/Android backends must have explicit owner mapping. No file is lost because a dependency is being removed.

## Restored original native mmap (first candidate)

`core/include/cmeta_mmap.h` and `core/src/cmeta_mmap.c` are derived mechanically from original `utils/include/cmeta_mmap.h` Git Blob `ba7aecd588492814ebca196d66023dfc9f24801c` and original `utils/src/cmeta_mmap.c` Git Blob `04e87de7bc565d77261e2de66c84380b85a0ac15`. The only production integration changes are replacing the obsolete umbrella `platform.h` include with the independent C11 linkage contract and platform-native Win32 includes, plus linking the source in existing `Salts::Core` (never a new DSO/legacy provider).

All **18 explicit** original mmap public entrypoints are present in the C11 header and implementation. A native real-file CTest verifies read/write/mapped range, dirty flush, page accounting, owner lifetime and multi-file POSIX group. Windows single-file API and independent C11/C++17 installed consumer ABI are required on every target platform. The historical Windows multi-view group-map reservation still requires a separately explicit real Windows conformance test; no missing Windows proof can be described as complete.

## Final gates

- Structural: run `python3 tools/check_full_source_migration.py`, plus `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_full_source_migration.py`. These **accept a truthful incomplete ledger**, and reject tampering, loss of source file/function evidence or unlinked source implementations.
- Functional: run `python3 tools/check_full_source_migration.py --require-complete`, which remains RED until missing/changed and unqualified cases are resolved with real installed/native tests. This is intentionally not substituted for the structural gate.
- No second provider, no CMeta/CFlow direct Core links, no symbol-only compatibility shim, no test-only owner offered as production.
- Use the canonical Stun-derived verified ccache and pinned re2c/vcpkg-cache from [Draft CI #90](https://github.com/qigao/salts-core/pull/90) when its independent prerequisite [FIFO #88](https://github.com/qigao/salts-core/pull/88) is merged. No per-file CI trigger bursts.

## Current 610-function implementation classification

This classification does **not** reduce the frozen 610-function denominator or
change final admission. It separates implementation work from evidence work so
already-restored native owners are not rewritten a second time.

- **468** functions have a production implementation or a mechanical native
  owner mapping and still require the final evidence policy.
- **83** are real remaining Core-native implementation work.
- **33** belong to the upper CMeta/CFlow split and must be qualified there,
  without a reverse runtime dependency into Core.
- **26** are the explicitly deferred AC/Levenshtein functions; they remain
  unwaived and keep final admission RED.

The 83 Core-native functions are: 26 Platform/thread functions, 37 Crypto
algorithm-surface functions, 7 historically declared-only mDNS functions,
7 callback-only filesystem-watch functions, and 6 bounded Process-retainer
functions. The 33 upper functions are the 14 CFlow filesystem executor
functions, 4 filesystem-watch Publisher functions, 14 CFlow Process IO
composition functions, and one CMeta metadata-validity function.

Important source facts:

- Original `cmeta_fs` 56/56 and `cmeta_process` 17/17 operations are
  mechanically owned by current `Salts::FS` and `Salts::Process`; they are
  evidence debt, not missing source.
- Base64 6/6 and buffer 29/29 are present in current Core. MPMC 7, mmap 18,
  Zstd 7 and error 4 were restored after the older Stage-A manifest was
  written.
- The frozen Salts tree contains only `utils/include/cmeta_mdns.h`; no mDNS
  implementation source or definitions exist in that donor tree. Those seven
  APIs therefore require a new native implementation and must not be described
  as recovered donor behavior.
- Original Crypto has a complete `utils/src/cmeta_crypto.c` implementation.
  The current sole `Salts::Crypto` archive already compiles primitives needed
  by 32/37 functions. Ed25519 (3) and X25519 (2) still require a reviewed
  implementation folded into that same archive; no second provider/archive is
  allowed.
- Callback-only `fs_watch` source and Linux/macOS/Windows backends are native
  and do not depend on CFlow. The reactive Publisher remains above Core.
- The bounded Process retainer belongs to the native Process owner; CFlow
  executor/IO actor composition remains above Core.

This section is planning/accounting evidence only. It does not qualify any
function for the final `--require-complete` gate by itself.
