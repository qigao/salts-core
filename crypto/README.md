# Crypto native module

`Salts::Crypto` is the source-owned cryptographic module of
[SaltsCore](../README.md). It produces exactly **one
cryptographic static archive**; do not compile or install another GmSSL or
generic ASN.1 reader within this module.

`crypto/src/asn1/crypto.c` contains ECDSA DER SignatureValue and RFC 8410
SPKI/PKCS8 format logic. The canonical general-purpose BER/DER, OID, TLV,
reader and owned Value Tree are under [../asn1/](../asn1/), exported as
`Salts::ASN1` and consumed directly. All public APIs are `Salts::XXX`
CMake targets, C11 source and C++17-usable C headers.

Use the repo root for the default ASN1/Crypto/CNet build or `cmake -S crypto`
to compile just Crypto against a previously installed ASN1 module. The
native GmSSL implementation is provided by the pinned vcpkg package
`gmssl 3.2.0#16` and imported through `GmSSL::GmSSL`. Its reviewed
extension source inputs are retained under `gmssl-extensions/`, without
a second local native GmSSL compilation. The original Crypto facade and
Ed448 objects remain in one `Salts::Crypto` static target, which links
the installed GmSSL static archive as a separate package dependency.
Private Ed448 libecc objects live under `vendor/libecc/` in this module.
No backwards-compatibility alias, fallback or duplicate BER/DER owner.

Run `python3 crypto/tools/check_local_native_source.py` from the repository
root to verify the immutable extension bytes and exact vcpkg dependency
identity before building. The retained
GmSSL-derived implementation and its licenses remain explicit; local source
ownership does not imply independent TLS reimplementation or completed
platform/security qualification. Production CNet consumes this same archive.

Installed consumers require `find_package(Crypto 0.1 CONFIG REQUIRED)`
and link `Salts::Crypto`. The config imports the sibling `Salts::ASN1`
and the pinned external `GmSSL::GmSSL` through `find_dependency`. The
installed GmSSL static SDK must therefore be available in the same verified
vcpkg dependency environment; Crypto does not silently bundle a second copy.
Direct protocol consumers should instead use only
`find_package(ASN1 0.1 CONFIG REQUIRED)` and `Salts::ASN1`.

## X.509 certificate inspection for TLS callers

The Crypto module also exposes read-only `<crypto/x509_der.h>`, whose
`crypto_x509_der_inspect` and `crypto_x509_der_chain_next` validate and
walk DER certificates through the one sibling `Salts::ASN1` codec. The
existing `crypto_tls_session_copy_peer_chain_v1_2` returns a bounded
caller-owned concatenated DER chain that can be consumed by this inspector
without changing GmSSL's authenticated TLS handshake or trust decisions.
See [X.509 DER scope](docs/X509-DER-ASN1-INSPECTION.md).
