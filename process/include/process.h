/**
 * @file process.h
 * @brief Cross-platform child process management without an event-loop dependency.
 *
 * A salts_process_t exclusively owns the child process, its process group or
 * Windows Job Object, redirected standard-I/O handles, monitor thread, and
 * terminal result. Operations are thread-safe except destroy, which requires
 * exclusive ownership. Destroying a running handle terminates and reaps the
 * owned process tree.
