# SaltsCore

**Status: bootstrap / Draft qualification. Not a production replacement yet.**

SaltsCore is an independently built **C11 foundation SDK**. It does not depend
on the historical `qigao/salts`, `qigao/salts-utils`, CMeta, CFlow, or CSTL
packages. Development is tracked by [migration epic #1](https://github.com/qigao/salts-core/issues/1).

The original M0 bootstrap implements an **owned-by-caller, non-owning counted byte view**
in `Salts::Core`. The stacked M1/M2 migration candidate adds
`Salts::Platform` (clock, OS CSPRNG, thread/synchronization) and
`Salts::Concurrency` (SPSC, bounded deadline queue, RCU, Disruptor,
ThreadPool and Leader/Followers). The next stacked candidate adds
`Salts::Coroutine` (the original minicoro-backed lifecycle, pool and
bounded sharded executor). These are imported from exact Salts sources and
have no CMeta/CFlow dependencies. The next Core foundation slice extracts
`mem_buffer_t`, `mem_slice_t` and the bounded slab allocator and the original single-owner bipartite `ring_buffer`
from old `salts/utils`, with only the independent Platform synchronization API. A further stacked candidate moves the
original NativeIO backend and Sharded/IPC ownership to
`Salts::NativeIO` (IOCP, epoll, io_uring, kqueue); the ACE completion-token
adapter remains in Salts and is not installed by Core. They require exact-head Linux/Windows/macOS
CI and installed C11/C++17 qualification before this candidate is accepted. It is not yet a replacement for any
published `Salts::Core` binary, and no old APIs or CMake aliases have been
cut over.

## Source layout and original module ownership

The repository root has **no** catch-all `include/` or `src/`. Each
existing module owns its own source and header tree:

- The explicitly retained `core/include`, `core/src` hold the Core byte and
  pool foundation and the **only** native `base64_utils.h` / `tn_base64_*`
  implementation. `fs/include, fs/src` and `process/include, process/src`
  retain their selected module names.
- `platform/`, `concurrency/`, `coroutine/`, `native-io/`, `cnet/`
  and `uri/` keep their existing names and private/public layout.
  The generated URI grammar remains under `uri/parser/`, and SCTP retains
  its independent `sctp/` subtree.
- Already-owned `unicode/`, `idna/`, `cserde/` and `tinytest/`
  keep their own layouts. Migration does not create source-path shims,
  duplicate providers or old module aliases.

The **installed** C11/C++17 SDK maintains documented include spellings
(`<base64_utils.h>`, `<random.h>`, `<cnet/cnet.h>`) and
`Salts::*` target identities; flat installed includes do **not** imply
flat root source ownership. `tools/check_module_layout.py` gates this
invariant on Linux, Windows and macOS.

## Default and optional modules

| Mandatory | Optional on supported platforms |
|---|---|
| Core byte views, Platform, Concurrency, FS, Coroutine, NativeIO, ASN1, Crypto, URI, CNet | Process, Unicode, IDNA, Serial, USB, Capture, Playback |

Unicode stays pinned to Unicode 17.0.0 with re2c as a **build-time** tool only;
IDNA depends only on the new Unicode module. FS and Process are native system
components; they **must not require** CFlow IO Actors or CMeta Reflection.
Advanced CMeta/CFlow/CSTL/Component/ACE functionality remains in `qigao/salts`
and consumes the new Core, never the other way round. The plain CNet transport
implementation is part of the default Core candidate; CMeta/ACE-specific
CNet integrations stay in Salts. Enabling a module does not establish its
cross-platform or release qualification.

See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for ownership and migration gates.

## Default local Crypto and CNet build (Draft)

The default graph builds the whole CNet transport source tree, including the
original IPC FIFO, peer index and native-path changes. Production CNet links
the first-party static `Salts::Crypto` facade and the **separately installed**
vcpkg `GmSSL::GmSSL` static library (GmSSL 3.2.0#17). No local native GmSSL
source mirror is compiled into `Salts::Crypto`; Ed448 remains first-party
under `crypto/vendor/libecc/`. CNet is the single production DSO owner of the
linked native TLS implementation; two independently loaded plugins must import
CNet instead of copying GmSSL/Crypto static archives.

Use CMake 3.21 or newer, a C11 compiler, and a C++17 compiler when testing.
Provide the canonical pinned c-ares, KCP and SIMDe dependencies and an installed
host re2c 4.6 with the pinned Unicode 17 data. The checked-in manifest makes
these base dependencies mandatory. The `cnet` feature remains an empty
compatibility feature and does not control the production target:

```sh
python3 crypto/tools/check_local_native_source.py
cmake -S . -B build-cnet -DBUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/verified-vcpkg-toolchain.cmake
cmake --build build-cnet --parallel
ctest --test-dir build-cnet --output-on-failure
```

The checked-in vcpkg manifest declares GmSSL and CNet dependencies directly.
The shared cache Actions use published `qigao/vcpkg-cache@v0.1.0` and the
custom registry selects `reference: v0.1.0`. vcpkg requires a 40-hex Git
`baseline`, which is pinned to the commit tagged by this release
(`05a10d73a5b1d01598e59d8cf34074513bd49df4`); this is the required registry schema, not a second
infrastructure version. GmSSL 3.2.0#17 remains pinned to its original
source and exact Git port tree. Binary-cache ABIs are still verified
independently of the Action release version.
The unified LLVM workflow builds and tests the native graph; the migration
remains Draft until the **same exact HEAD** passes its complete checks.

An unavailable dependency fails configuration, without substituting another
TLS provider or an implicit transport fallback. Local source ownership does
not make the retained GmSSL-derived implementation third-party-free. Exact
current-source platform CI, TLS/CA/SAN and independent peer tests, sanitizers,
installed consumers, and physical runtime ownership still gate acceptance.
No downstream cutover or production release is implied by this candidate.

## Local build

```sh
cmake --preset native-release-user
cmake --build --preset native-release-user
ctest --preset native-release-user
```

The parent environment supplies the vcpkg and LLVM chainload toolchains,
triplets and install prefix consumed by the preset. Missing inputs fail at
configure time. Installed-consumer and smoke projects are intentionally not
part of the build or CI contract.

The standalone install exports `Salts::Core` through
`find_package(SaltsCore CONFIG REQUIRED)`. Optional targets will be exported
only when their independent implementations and platform gates are qualified.

## Native LLVM thread and scheduler contract

The unified CI workflow uses the shared vcpkg-cache compiler setup on
Linux/macOS x64 and ARM64 (runner-native Clang), and Windows x64 and ARM64
(llvm-mingw/UCRT 20261020). It builds the complete configured graph and runs
its formal native CTest suite. The workflow does not build installer/consumer
projects or run compiler/source preflight probes.

Platform public declarations explicitly export/import their one shared DLL
owner, including native thread, clock, random, readiness and fast-key APIs.
The coroutine scheduler uses the same compiler-selected thread-local storage
contract as Platform/Executor. The existing coroutine test overlaps two live
OS threads and verifies that each sees only its own scheduler, then restores
an empty current-scheduler state on thread exit.

The migration integration must pass the same full native graph before a
The 0.1.002 source release carries the flattened public headers. SIMD execution
is owned by SaltsUtils and
is no longer built or exported by SaltsCore.
